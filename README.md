# DSCI-303-Comma-Report
Repository for Tate Ward and Vicky Liu's DSCI 303 final project, exploring SurveyMonkey's Comma Dataset

File Descriptions: We have several different files where we looked into different prediction problems with slightly different approahces.

-Comma_Dataset_Model_Exploration.ipynb: This file should be used to examine the pre-processing steps we took with our data, such as cleaning, feature engineering, etc. All other files use the same general data cleaning and pre-processing steps as this file. It also contains a short exploratory data analysis followed by an investigation into optimizing the income prediction problem specifically using F1 score of the minority class as the objective. Finally, this file contains code for some visualizations and model interpretations.

-Grammar_Education.ipynb: In this file, we investigate optimizing models for accuracy on household income using grammar-related features. Similar to the model exploration file but optimizes for accuracy instead of F1 on the minority class. Uses the same data preprocessing steps.

-Grammar_Age.ipynb: In this file, we investigate optimizing models for accuracy on age using grammar-related features. Uses the same general data preprocessing steps as above files.

-Grammar_Age.ipynb: In this file, we investigate optimizing models for accuracy on education level using grammar-related features. Uses the same general data preprocessing steps as above files.

-DSCI303 project Modeling Data.xlsx: spreadsheet containing the general results of our investigations into the different questions, with model details and performances.
